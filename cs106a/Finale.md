## Look How Far You've Come
- 60% of CS106A students come in with less than 10 hours of coding experience and now look at all you can do.
- Be proud!
- In the past 10 weeks you've written over 200 lines of code!

## Life After 106A
- After 106A comes 106b where you'll dive into C++, a phenomenal language and the love of my life.
- Hope to see you all there!

## Final Quiz Topics include:
- sorted
- map
- max
- min
- lambda functions
- dictionaries
- a capstone 106a problem

### Capstone 106A problem
- read a file
- split line on something
- do some sort of casting to a different type
- update a data structure with info
all snippets of code (e.g. a short method) along with a specific description of the bug, but please do not abuse this by sending me your entire program. 

I'll miss your faces and hopefully I can meet you all in person when we all find ourselves back on campus
