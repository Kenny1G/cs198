# Welcome to CS106A!

## Section 
- Section is a fun way to learn CS in addition to lecture.  
- Ask questions during section and interrupt me whenever is necessary.
- Attendance and participation in section is part of your grade. Participating includes
   - Answering/Asking questions
   - Encouraging other sectionees
   - Evident attention
- If you can't make it to section, you can attend another section... In that case, email me with the name of the section leader whose section you attended


## Homework 
- Homework is submitted through [Paperless](https://paperless.stanford.edu).
- You can submit to Paperless multiple times, and I will only look at your most recent submission unless you specifically tell me otherwise.
- I will also try to return all assignments to you within a week so that you have feedback on your last assignment before the next one is due.

## Late Policy 
- Work turned in by the due date will get a 2% on-time bonus.
- Work turned in after the due date has a 48 hour full-credit grace period (Unless otherwise stated in the assignment). 
- Work turned in later than 48 hours loses 15% credit per day beyond the grace period. 
- If you turn something in very late, please contact me so I know it's there to grade. 
- Contact the head TA to arrange extra time for extraordinary circumstances.

## Interactive Grading 
- For each assignment, you and I will spend about fifteen minutes going over your solution, 
- We will discuss things you did excellently and discuss any areas for improvement.  
- You can also use IGs to ask questions about the course or the next assignment.  
- Note: Attending IGs are also part of your grade

## LaIR Hours 
- If you are ever stuck on an assignment  come to the LaIR! 
- You can usually find me there on Sundays from 5pm to 7pm (PST) but you can get help from any section leader. 
- LaIR is good for both conceptual questions (How does a for loop work?) and help with debugging your code.


## Contacting me 
- If you have any questions or concerns about the course, email me. 
- If you have a bug and the LaIR is not open, you can also email me small snippets of code (e.g. a short method) along with a specific description of the bug, but please do not abuse this by sending me your entire program. 
- You can expect to get a reply from me within 24 hours.

Have fun! CS106A can be hard, but by the end of this course, you will be writing powerful programs to solve real problems. Hopefully, you find the assignments and material rewarding as well as challenging.
