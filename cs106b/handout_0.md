# Welcome to CS106B!

##About Me
My name is Kenny- I'm a first year transfer and sophomore majoring in CS on the Systems Track. I enjoy a good book, just finished dune. I'm excited to get to know everyone

## Section 
- Section is a fun way to learn CS in addition to lecture.  
- Ask questions during section and interrupt me whenever is necessary.
- Attendance and participation in section is part of your grade. Participating includes
   - Answering/Asking questions
   - Encouraging other sectionees
   - Evident attention
- If you can't make it to section, you can attend another section... In that case, email me with the name of the section leader whose section you attended
- Let me know if there is ANYTHING you need (CS and non-CS related), and I will do my best to help out.


## Homework 
- Homework is submitted through [Paperless](https://paperless.stanford.edu).
- You can submit to Paperless multiple times, and I will only look at your most recent submission unless you specifically tell me otherwise.
- I will also try to return all assignments to you within a week so that you have feedback on your last assignment before the next one is due.

## Late Policy 
- Work turned in by the due date will get a (pretty) small on-time bonus.
- Work turned in after the due date has a 48 hour full-credit grace period (Unless otherwise stated in the assignment). 
- After the 48 hour grace period, submissions are not accepted unless a prior arrangement has been made.
- Contact the head TA to arrange extra time for extraordinary circumstances.

## Interactive Grading 
- For each assignment, you and I will spend about fifteen minutes going over your solution, 
- We will discuss things you did excellently and discuss any areas for improvement.  
- You can also use IGs to ask questions about the course or the next assignment.  
- I will send out a scheduling email after the due date of each assignment... It will contain the link to the paperless page for signing-up for a slot. Please be on the look-out for these.
- Note: Attending IGs are also part of your grade

## LaIR Hours 
- If you are ever stuck on an assignment  come to the LaIR! 
- You can usually find me there on Sundays from 5pm to 7pm (PST) but you can get help from any section leader. 
- LaIR is good for both conceptual questions (What is a stack?) and help with debugging your code.

## Style
- The style guide can be found on the website at the link ["Guide to Style"](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1216/resources/style_guide.html).
- Generally, I expect most functions to be about 25 to 30 lines long. Think of this as a
speed limit  if the speed limit is 30 mph and you go 32 mph, the cops won’t mind. If you
go 60 mph, well, that’s a cause for a ticket (or a lower grade).
- Single-line or in-line comments should begin with //. Multi-line comments should be in
the 
 `/* Hello.
   * Please imagine that this is a multi-line comment!
   */`
form.
- As your grader, I care about consistency. If you have random spaces in your code for
example, your style grade will reflect that.
- This is definitely a hard skill to learn. Don’t worry about your first style grade. Once you
get a feel for good style, it comes naturally!

## Contacting me 
- If you have any questions or concerns about the course, email me. 
- If you have a bug and the LaIR is not open, you can also email me small snippets of code (e.g. a short method) along with a specific description of the bug, but please do not abuse this by sending me your entire program. 
- You can expect to get a reply from me within 24 hours.

Have fun! CS106B can be hard, but by the end of this course, you will be writing powerful programs to solve real problems. Hopefully, you find the assignments and material rewarding as well as challenging.
